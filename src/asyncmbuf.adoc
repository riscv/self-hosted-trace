== Asynchronous Memory Buffer ISA Extension (Ssamb)

An asynchronous memory buffer (AMB) serves as a sink for trace, or similar asynchronous data, generated by hardware in parallel with software execution.  Multiple such buffers may be implemented by a hart, depending on the number of separate sources of asynchronous data generation implemented.

The buffer is contiguous in the virtual address space, but may be distributed in the physical (or guest physical) address space.  It is a circular buffer, such that writes commence at the base, and overwrite any older data there, once the buffer is full.  There exists a mechanism to pend a local interrupt before the buffer wraps, for cases where software does not wish to have any asynchronous data overwritten.

Ssamb is never implemented as a stand-alone extension. Each instance of Ssamb is implemented alongside one or more extensions that include a source of asynchronous data, such as Sspdis or Smstrc/Ssstrc.  For each instance of Ssamb the `samb*` registers below will be implemented, with names and CSR numbers specific to the feature or extension that employs Ssamb.

WARNING: _There is still an open question whether AMB should simply require pinned pages, and throw an error if a translation fault occurs.  Other architectures have such requirements.  Pinning requires that the entire buffer be kept resident, which adds to memory pressure, and limits the size of the buffer. But it avoids some hardware complexity and page fault overheads.  If pinning is not required, then pre-translation likely needs to be required, so that trace flush does not require a translation fault or guest-page fault._

==== Supervisor Asynchronous Memory Buffer Configuration and Status Register (`sambcs`)

The `sambcs` register is a 64-bit WARL register that provides configuration and status fields for the asynchronous memory buffer.  

For RV32, bits 63:32 of `sambcs` can be accessed via the `sambcsh` CSR.

When EN=1, the AMB is enabled to receive asynchronous data from source(s).  Once enabled, the AMB may translate buffer page(s), which can result in translation faults and/or guest-page faults, and cache those translations.  See <<ambaddr>> for address translation details, and see <<ambendis>> for details on enabling and disabling AMB.

The buffer size is 2^SIZE+12^, supporting sizes from 4 KB (SIZE=0) to 4 GB (SIZE=20).  SIZE values 21..31 are reserved.  An AMB instance may support only a subset of SIZE values.  The maximum supported size can be discovered by writing all 1s to SIZE and reading back the resulting value.  All sizes between the minimum (4 KB) and the maximum supported size are supported.

WARNING: _The largest AUX buffer size allowed by Linux perf for self-hosted trace from other architectures is 4 MiB, but those require pinned memory._

The BMIEN bit enables buffer management interrupts.  When BMIEN=1, a local asynchronous memory buffer interrupt (LAMBI) is pended when hardware increment of `sambaddr` causes the two most significant bits of the write pointer offset portion to transition to match BMITH.  For example, if BMIEN=1 and BMITH=2, a LAMBI will be pended when the buffer is half full.

The TF and BMI bits report the source of a pended LAMBI.  When BMI=1, a buffer management interrupt was pended.  When TF=1, a buffer translation fault occurred, see <<ambaddr>> for address translation details.  Hardware sets these bits when the LAMBI is pended.  Software should clear them once the associated LAMBI has been serviced.

When a buffer translation fault occurs, the buffer offset associated with the offending page is written to TFPTR, such that the full virtual address of the page base can be derived by combining the base address portion of `sambaddr` with the offset value as shown below.

FaultAddress = (`sambaddr` & (2^`sambcs`.SIZE+12^ - 1)) | (`sambcs`.TFPTR<<12)

NOTE: _Because implementations may pre-translate AMB pages (see <<ambaddr>>), translation faults can occur both for the current page (indicated by the address in `sambaddr`) and for following pages that have not yet been written.  Thus the address in `sambaddr` may not reflect the page that incurred the AMB translation fault.  TFPTR provides the means to report a fault to a different page within the AMB._

NOTE: _After an AMB translation fault or guest-page fault is raised, if EN=1 hardware should attempt to translate the page anew once the TF bit is cleared by software, indicating that the page is now available._

WARNING: _Extensions that use AMB probably want to include a bit that inhibits asynchronous data generation during LAMBI handling.  Inhibit for any interrupt to mode __x__ when __x__cause.LAMBI=1?_

The EMPTY bit is a read-only indication to software that all internally buffered asynchronous data has been flushed and is visible to software reads.

NOTE: _EMPTY should factor in any empty indication from the associated data source(s), such that EMPTY is set only when all enabled data sources are empty._

The WRAP bit indicates that the buffer has wrapped at least once, and hence the data above the write pointer is valid.

The TRV bit is a read-only indication to software that the hardware has successfully translated the buffer current page, and optionally one or more following pages.  

Software should only write to `sambcs` while any associated asynchronous data sources are disabled and `sambcs`.EMPTY=1, to avoid race conditions with hardware updates and configuration changes while AMB writes are in flight.  AMB behavior is UNSPECIFIED otherwise.

==== Supervisor Asynchronous Memory Buffer Address Register (`sambaddr`)

The `sambaddr` register is an SXLEN-wide WARL register that holds the virtual address to which the next byte of asynchronous data will be written.  Upon each hardware write to the AMB, the address is incremented by the number of bytes written.

The address actually comprises the buffer base and the write pointer offset.  Because the buffer base is aligned to its size, the write pointer offset is `sambaddr`[(11 + `sambcs`.SIZE):0].  When hardware writes the last byte of the buffer, the write pointer offset portion wraps to 0.

Some instantiations of AMB may support only buffer writes that are aligned to a fixed size.  In such cases the least significant bits of `sambaddr`, those that offset into the aligned range, may be hardcoded to 0.

`sambaddr` need not be capable of holding an invalid address.

Software should only write to `sambaddr` while AMB is disabled (`sambcs`.EN=0).  AMB write behavior is UNSPECIFIED otherwise.

==== Interrupt Registers

WARNING: _This section gets integrated into 3.1.9 and others_

The local asynchronous memory buffer interrupt (LAMBI) bit in `mip`, `mie`, and `mideleg` is writable.  For implementations that support S-mode, the LAMBI bit in `sip` and `sie` is writable.  For implementations that support the H extension, the LAMBI bit in `vsip` and `vsie` is writable, and, when `mideleg`.LAMBI=1, the LAMBI bit in `hideleg` is writable.

For implementations that support Smaia, the LAMBI bit in `mvip` and `mvien` is writable.  For implementations that support Smaia/Ssaia and the H extension, the LAMBI bit in `hvip` and `hvien` is writable.

LAMBI is bit 14 in all registers reference above.  The priority of LAMBIs lies immediately below that of local counter overflow interrupts (LCOFIs).

=== Enabling and Disabling

When enabling asynchronous data collection, software should first initialize `sambaddr`, then configure and enable AMB by writing `sambcs`.  For RV32, `sambcsh` should be initialized before AMB is enabled in `sambcs`.

Once AMB is enabled (`sambcs`.EN=1), translation of the current AMB page (at `sambaddr`), and optionally one or more following page(s), will commence.  It is recommended that software wait until `sambcs`.TRV=1 before enabling enabling the asynchronous data source(s), to avoid loss of data while waiting for this translation process.  One or more translation faults and/or guest-page faults may have to be serviced before TRV=1.

When disabling asynchronous data collection, software should first disable asynchronous data source(s), which will initiate a flush of any internally buffered data.  Software should then wait until AMB reports empty (`sambcs`.EMTPY=1).  After this AMB can be disabled by clearing `sambcs`.EN.

Execution of the enabling or disabling steps described above in a different order risks asynchronous data loss.  See <<datamgmt>> for more details on data loss.

=== Memory Semantics

Like other stores, the ordering and cache semantics of hardware AMB writes are dictated by PMAs and/or page-based memory types (Svpbmt).  However, hardware writes of asynchronous data are not ordered with respect to explicit memory operations, including FENCE instructions.  Further, AMB writes are not ordered with respect to other AMB writes, or other implicit writes.  To effect an asynchronous data fence software should follow the AMB disable steps described in <<ambendis>>. 

[NOTE]
====
_For asynchronous data sources that are processed offline (e.g., instruction trace), it is likely desirable to assign buffer pages a non-cacheable but weakly ordered attribute (e.g., PBMT=NC).  This avoids having trace data that won't be read soon displace workload working set data from the caches._

_For asynchronous data sources that are processed online (e.g., sample records, such that each record is collected as it is written), it may be desirable to assign buffer pages a cacheable attribute.  This avoids adding cache-miss latency to online collection routines._

=== Asynchronous Data Management

Any dropping of asynchronous data must happen at the source, to ensure that the data loss is recoverable.  An AMB implementation must apply backpressure to the source to avoid scenarios where asynchronous data may be dropped downstream from the source.

[NOTE]
====
_Asynchronous data loss typically results from scenarios where the data is being produced faster than the AMB can consume it.  If this persists, any internal buffering will fill and new data will have to be dropped.  Once internal buffers are able to drain, new data can again be consumed.  The data source is expected to ensure that processing software can recover from any data loss, which may require indication of the data loss within the data stream._

_If the data source is enabled while AMB is disabled, or while AMB is awaiting a translation for the current page, the AMB is unable to sink any data.  It is recommended to avoid such scenarios by following the guidance in <<ambendis>>, otherwise data loss is likely._

_To avoid scenarios where the source is flushed but the AMB is not able to sink all asynchrononous data bytes, the implementation should backpressure the source before the remaining translated AMB space is less than the size of the internal buffer.  Otherwise there is a risk that a translation fault and/or guest-page fault is needed to in order to sink buffered data, and the trap could lead to the source being disabled (e.g., due to context switch) before the fault is handled.  This would result in unrecoverable data loss._

=== Privilege and Address Translation

The effective privilege mode of AMB writes is selected by bits associated with each AMB instance in `menvcfg` and, if the H extension is implemented, `henvcfg`.  For the AMB associated with self-hosted trace (STRC), the full set of configuration options is illustrated below.

[options="header", width="70%"]
|===
| `menvcfg`.STRCS | `henvcfg`.STRCV | Privilege | Translation
| 0 | - | M-mode | None (Bare)
| 1 | 0 | S/HS-mode | `satp`
| 1 | 1 | VS-mode | `vsatp`/`hgatp`
|===

[NOTE]
====
_Using a fixed effective privilege mode for asynchronous data writes, rather than using the current privilege mode, allows supporting system-wide uses, where recording persists across privilege modes._

_This mechanism is also motivated by an expectation that implementations may buffer asynchronous data internally before it is emitted to the AMB, in order to avoid data loss during asynchronous data bursts.  This translation approach avoids the need to delay traps and trap returns by requiring internal buffers to be flushed before the current privilege mode changes.  Asynchronous data can continue to be emitted with the same privilege and translation despite changes to the current privilege mode._
====

WARNING: _This does not cleanly support a nested hypervisor tracing/monitoring a true guest.  In such a usage, the guest trace would ideally use the nested hypervisor's `vsatp`/`hgatp` to translate AMB addresses.  In the TG we discussed adding `tatp` and `hgtatp` registers that are used just for translation of AMB addresses, and could be assigned the values of the nested hypervisor's `vsatp`/`hgatp` in this usage.  But this feels like overkill to support this usage.  A root hypervisor can support this usage using its own `satp` to translate AMB addresses during guest execution, then map those physical AMB pages to the nested hypervisor's AMB range via `hgatp`._

The process of translating AMB write addresses can result in translation faults.  A page fault incurred during first-stage translation, based on `satp` when the effective privilege mode is S-mode or `vsatp` when the effective privilege mode is VS-mode, pends a LAMBI interrupt with a cause of translation fault (`sambcs`.TF=1), and the buffer offset of the offending page indicated in `sambcs`.TFPTR.

NOTE: _Unlike explicit stores, asynchronous memory buffer writes do not raise "Store/AMO Page Fault" exceptions as a result of translation faults.  By instead pending a LAMBI with TF=1, an AMB translation fault can remain pending if it cannot be handled in the current privilege mode._

A page fault incurred during the second stage, or G-stage, translation raises a Store/AMO guest-page fault, just as explicit and other implicit stores do.  When AMB writes execute with VS-mode privilege, and Store/AMO guest-page faults are delegated to S-mode (mideleg[23]=1), translating of AMB pages must be suspended while in M-mode.  This avoids Store/AMO guest-page faults raised in M-mode, where they cannot be handled.

NOTE: _If the asynchronous data source is backpressured while waiting for the current AMB page to be translated, there is a risk of data loss due to internal buffer overflow.  One method to avoid such loss is to pre-translate the next AMB page(s), ensuring that the translation(s) are cached before the page(s) need to be written.  A simple implementation would cache translations for the current and next AMB page.  When page X is filled, writes transition to (already translated) page X+1, and translation begins for page X+2.  It is recommended that the number of pages pre-translated is sufficient to match or exceed the size of any internal buffering, to ensure that the internal buffer can always be flushed without requiring a page walk or translation fault._

NOTE: _It is expected that configurations that select VS-mode privilege for AMB writes are used only by, or on behalf of, a virtualization guest running when V=1.  Such a configuration would naturally inhibit asynchronous data generation in M-mode, hence the suspension of AMB page translations described above does not risk data loss, assuming the pre-translation guidelines above are followed._

[NOTE]
====
_Depending on the AMB size and the asynchronous data rate, AMB writes can touch many pages in a short amount of time.  However, AMB uses page translations efficiently, writing exclusively to a single page until it is full, then moving to the next and writing exclusively to it.  Rather than allowing AMB writes to displace explicit memory access translations from the primary TLB, it may be more efficient to store cached AMB translations in a very small dedicated AMB TLB.  Two entries (current page and next page) will be sufficient for most implementations, though more may be warranted if the implementation pre-translates more than one page ahead._

_Cached AMB page translations can be flushed by SFENCE and HFENCE instructions, globally or per ASID/VMID, just as other translations are.  Such fence operations may result in asynchronous data loss if performed while AMB is enabled and not empty.  Cached AMB page translations are also flushed when `sambcs`.EN is cleared._
